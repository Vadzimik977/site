This element was the embodiment of pure energy and matter, maintaining the harmony and stability of all things. Its power and energy permeated every corner of the cosmos, shaping the laws of physics and creating the basis for life. But one day something incredible happened — a cataclysm that changed the course of history forever.",

    "s2Text": "Thonium, possessing infinite energy, entered into an unstable interaction with the environment. As a result of this interaction, subatomic particles began to oscillate, leading to a cascading quantum explosion. In a flash of unprecedented power, Thonium disintegrated into 118 separate elements. These elements scattered throughout the universe, creating new planets and forming the basis for diverse life forms.",
